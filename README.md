# penMCFM: Weibull Mixture Cure Frailty Model with High-dimensional Covariates  

 In this work,  we introduce a novel extension of the Weibull mixture cure model by incorporating frailty, employed to model the latency component. Additionally, high-dimensional covariates are integrated into both the cure rate and latency parts of the model, providing a comprehensive approach to analyze high-dimensional omics data. 

 We apply the novel approach to analyze genome-wide RNAseq gene expression data from bulk breast cancer patients sourced from  The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
